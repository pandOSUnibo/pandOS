Workflow
========

This project uses `GitFlow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`__ to manage branches.
Progress and issues are tracked using GitHub Projects.

There are two repositories:
* pandOS, which is the main repository;
* docs, which contains the automatically generated documentation.
